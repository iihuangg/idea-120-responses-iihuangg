Many of Murray's predictions about the future of television and its interaction with online virtual spaces are correct. Her predictions about how people will consume media in the future hit the nail on the head. She speculated that viewers would log their responses to what they're watching as they're watching it and congregate in online spaces to have discussions about what they just saw. The former scenario is something known as live-blogging, and while it's typically used to cover events and news, many people live-blog the content their consuming to share their in the moment reactions and opinions. The latter is seen on sites like Reddit, where there are dedicated spaces known as subreddits for discussing and sharing content related to an individual piece of media. Murray also foresaw viewer participation going from "sequential activities (watch, then interact), to simultaneous but separate activities (interact while watching), to a merged experience (watch and interact in the same environment)." While this isn't exactly used for television, it is reminiscent of an increasingly popular form of media known as livestreaming. Individuals will livestream themselves doing an activity, typically playing a video game, and interact with their viewers, who can communicate with each other and the streamer via a chat function. Some shows are livestreamed, like *Critical Role*, but often the people in the show do not interact with the viewers and the chat is used for viewers to interact with each other. Obviously, not everything Murray predicted was right, and a topic she focuses strongly upon, the interactive and immersive experience for the viewers, is not really seen at all in mainstream television. I find that there is still little interaction between the viewer and the happenings of a show, and that typically, their input does not have a very strong impact on what comes next. That's not to say there isn't any, but television that does feature this kind of interaction is seen as experimental and not the norm. Active audience participation in a plot is much more commonly found in things like video games, a medium that is inherently interactive, rather than more traditional media like television and movies. Despite this, Murray's predictions about television and virtual environments were, for the most part, very accurate.

Murray briefly mentions that the improvement of technology will cause an eventual "explosion of virtual architecture." She also talks about how these virtual spaces will allow for people to access previously inaccessible environments and how it may become a new form of art. These concepts can be seen in the set design for *The Mandalorian*, where LED walls are used to display realistic pre-rendered backgrounds made in a video game engine in place of the more standard green screen. This virtual set makes it so that actors can feel like they're present in the setting of their fictional world without having to actually be there. They are much more immersed than they are when working with green screen. It functions as a layer of reality for them since they do not have to focus on imagining what their surroundings look like in post-production, they can already see what it looks like themselves while on set. The viewers also benefit from this, as the LED backgrounds look so realistic that they cannot tell the show was not filmed on location, whereas it can sometimes be easy to tell when stuff is made with green screen, when noticing things like green spill.
