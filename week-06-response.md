The issue that Bridle discusses in his article is very real and pervasive. These automated, bot-run children's YouTube channels push out videos that can only be described as uncanny valley. It's all machine made, an amalgamation of stock animation and audio, with everything being so far removed from content created by human hands, it's unsettling. These kinds of videos are not particularly dangerous to adolescents or adults, we just find it disturbing—and even mildly humorous, made evident by the memes surrounding the Johny Johny video that were popular some years prior—but if this is all a young child watches, this is all they know. This is what they perceive to be normal. It becomes even worse when looking at the astoundingly high number of violent and "gross-out" parodies of children's shows. But content like this is pushed by the algorithm, so naturally people make more of it to make more profit. Bridle correctly identifies the automated infrastructures as the root problem, rather than the users. Thus, the solution he presents is rather more complex than simply moderating children more. Corporations need to be held accountable, they need to fix the systems they've built that cause these kinds of problems. But, as he says, there seems to be no viable way to fully respond without shutting down the whole service. YouTube may have done a massive purge of this so called children's content, but the problem still persists, videos like these are still being made. The problem hasn't *really* been addressed, a bandage has just been placed atop to cover it up. It calls into question whether a solution will ever truly exist without a complete overhaul to all the structures in place. But maybe that's exactly what we need: a complete overhaul. Total reformation. It would no doubt be a long and arduous process, but if that's what's required to prevent issues like this from arising, then so be it. Experiences on the internet were incredibly formative for people like Bridle and myself, who grew up on the internet, and will continue to be so for future generations. Obviously not everything needs to be catered to making safe spaces for children, that's entirely unrealistic and, more importantly, undesirable, but we should make sure that spaces already meant for children are devoid of harmful content.
