![FFXIV Cash Shop Advertisement](https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/t/de1f0bcac33209ceb1455927582ca781824828ef.png?1551175444)

The image I linked is of an advertisement for *Final Fantasy XIV*'s online cash shop that offers optional items for players. Said items being presented in the advertisement are a mount and a set of emotes. Typically, when new content is added, *FFXIV*'s player base is either happy, if they are interested in buying the items released, or indifferent if they are not. However, when other MMOs, such as *World of Warcraft* or *The Elder Scrolls Online*, put out similar advertisements for cash shop items, it is received very differently. For example, whenever the official *WoW* YouTube channel releases a video announcing a new cash shop mount, the number of dislikes are significantly higher than the likes. Many comments talk about how paid content like this ruins the game, and how they should not be paying for items when they already paid for the game and for a monthly subscription to keep playing. *FFXIV*, like *WoW*, has a monthly subscription fee and cash shop items, but the players' reaction to said cash shop items differ greatly. There are many reasons behind this discrepancy in player reaction, but it can mainly be attributed to Blizzard, the company that made *WoW*, making predatory marketing and game design choices, whereas Square Enix, *FFXIV*'s company, has not. Thus, *WoW* players tend to view the cash shop items as another ploy for Blizzard to leech money out of players and *FFXIV* players see them as fun bonuses. The same kind of image advertising the same kind of content is read very differently based on the games presenting it.

The linguistic message the image is, obviously, advertising the fact that Square Enix has made new optional items available. The non-coded, or denoted message is simple, the image displays a character riding a mount of a cat on the left and three characters doing various emotes with light sticks on the right. It is showing that these are the two new optional items. The coded/connoted message is slightly more complicated. By looking at the items being sold, one can figure out approximately the amount they cost. Mounts tend to vary in price depending on how many characters can ride on them at once or some other special attribute. The mount shown off in the image shows only a single character riding it, so you know it is on the cheaper end. Emotes usually cost $7, but a person familiar with *FFXIV* may know that the emotes being displayed in this particular image are from an old limited event held in-game, meaning that they're cheaper than ones exclusively available through the cash shop.

Partner Response - I think it's interesting how you related this assignment with how people recieve microtrasactions differently based on the way their presented and what company  presents them. It makes me think about what is the better approach to marketing in-game items, Blizzards way of using marketing tactics, or just use something like the image  above? I think the  image above is revieved better is because they don't feel like they are being forced to buy it where as other companies try and persuade you into buying it by  having a fancy trailer to get you excited about it. Personally, I don't think I would mind the marketing tactics as long as it doesn't turn into a pay wall, so that makes me wonder what design changes does Blizzard do to get people to buy stuff because that would definetly get people annoyed?
